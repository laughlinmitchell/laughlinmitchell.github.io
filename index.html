  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I’m an economist working on public policy, with interests in climate,
    long-run growth, and doing good in a way that’s sustainable rather than performative.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site replaces LinkedIn and Facebook. It’s a place for longer-form writing,
    transparency about what I support, and projects I’m thinking about.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m based in Australia.
